1. Write a query that returns all customer purchases of product IDs 4 and 9. 

2. Write two queries, one using two conditions with an AND operator, and one using the BETWEEN operator, that will return all customer purchases made from vendors with vendor IDs between 8 and 10 (inclusive). 

3. Can you think of two different ways to change the final query we looked at so it would return purchases from days when it wasn't raining? See original query below:

SELECT 
   
 market_date, 
   
 customer_id, 
   
 vendor_id, 
   
 quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty price
FROM farmers_market.customer_purchases
WHERE 
   
 market_date IN
      
 (
      
 SELECT market_date
      
 FROM farmers_market.market_date_info
      
 WHERE market_rain_flag = 1
      
 )
LIMIT 5
